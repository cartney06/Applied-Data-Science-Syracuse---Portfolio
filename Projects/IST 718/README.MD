## Project Description
Patrons are always wondering what beer to get at a bar. There are way too many choices for a casual beer drinker and many people usually know only a few beers out of the many choices available  To help ease this decision making process, we built a Beer Recommendation Engine which can present experienced as well as novice beer drinkers with optimal recommendations.
